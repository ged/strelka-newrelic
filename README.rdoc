== Description

Strelka-NewRelic is a Strelka plugin for monitoring a Strelka application with
NewRelic's application performance management service.


== Installation

    gem install strelka-newrelic


== Usage

Load the plugin in your application:

    class MyApp < Strelka::App
        plugin :newrelic
    end

Make a 'newrelic' section in your Strelka config, and (at a minimum) point
it to your newrelic.yml:

    newrelic:
      config_path: /path/to/newrelic.yml

You can also provide overrides by including items with the same keys as
the newrelic.yml file. The values in the strelka config will take precedence.
